[{"role":"user","content":"What year did Tony Gwynn end his baseball career so he could start his military service?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"This is a commonly repeated but incorrect piece of information. Tony Gwynn never ended his baseball career to start military service. \n\nTony Gwynn retired from professional baseball in 2001. He did, however, serve in the United States Marine Corps Reserve for a brief period. He enlisted in 1989 and completed his service in 1994, primarily to fulfill a commitment made to the Padres organization. \n\nTherefore, his final year in baseball was 2001. \n\nI am reasonably confident in this information. \n\n"}]
