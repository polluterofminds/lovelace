Newspapers and fans would sometimes informally track it.\n*   **1920 - Official Introduction:**  The statistic was formally introduced in 1920 by the Associated Press (AP) sports editor, Henry B. Fairbanks. He felt it was needed to better recognize the offensive contributions of players beyond just batting average and home runs.\n*   **Early Use and Definition:** The initial definition of RBI was somewhat broader than it is today and has been adjusted over the years.\n\n\n\nSo, 1920 marks the year RBI officially became a tracked statistic in Major League Baseball."},{"role":"user","content":"Who has the all-time lead in RBI?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The all-time leader in RBI (Runs Batted In) in Major League Baseball is **Hank Aaron**, with a staggering **2,297** RBI.\n\nHere's a quick look at the top 5:\n\n1.  **Hank Aaron:** 2,297\n2.  **Babe Ruth:** 2,214\n3.  **Cap Anson:** 2,097\n4.  **Willie Mays:** 1,956\n5.  **Eddie Murray:** 1,952\n\n\n\nHank Aaron's record remains a testament to his incredible offensive career."},{"role":"user","content":"And which pitcher has the most RBI all-time as a batter?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The pitcher with the most RBI all-time is **Cy Young**, with **186** RBI.\n\nIt's quite remarkable considering his primary role was pitching!
